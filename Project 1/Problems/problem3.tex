\section*{Problem 3}


In order to discretize equation \eqref{eq:bvp} we start by discretizing the domain for $x$. For the discretization we use $n+1$ evenly spaced and unique points for which we assign the index $i=0, 1, ..., n$. The step length $\Delta x$ between each $i$ within $\mathcal{D}(x)$ is then $\Delta x = \frac{x_n - x_0}{n} = \frac{1-0}{n}=\frac{1}{n}$. The value of $x$ at $i$ is then given by $x_i = x_0 + i\Delta x = i\Delta x$. 

For the discretization of the full equation we further define the notation: $u(x_i) := u_i$ and $u(x_i \pm \Delta x) = u_{i\pm 1 x}$. 

There are three parts that needs to be defined in the new discrete space:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the analytical solution of eqation \eqref{eq:exact_solution}
    \item the RHS $f(x)$
    \item and LHS $\frac{d^{2}u}{dx^{2}}$
\end{itemize}


For the analytical solution we then get the discretized version by using the defined notation

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:discrete_u_i}
    u_i = 1 - (1-e^{-10})x_i - e^{-10x_i} \quad .
\end{equation}

The RHS function is similary discretized by 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:discrete_f_i}
     f_i = 100e^{-10x_i} \quad , 
\end{equation}

where we used $f_i := f(x_i)$. 

To solve the equation we also need to discretize the left hand side differentiation. The second order derivative is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^{2}u}{dx^{2}} = u''(x) =  
\frac{u(x+\Delta x) - 2u(x) + u(x-\Delta x)}{(\Delta x)^{2}} +
\mathcal{O}((\Delta x )^{2})
\end{equation}

from there we approximate the solution by removing $\mathcal{O}((\Delta x )^{2})$ ($v(x) := u(x) - \mathcal{O}((\Delta x )^{2}) \implies v(x) \approx u(x)$) and discretize using the previously defined notation. This yields the expression
$$
v''_i = 
\frac{v_{i+1} - 2v_i + v_{i-1}}{(\Delta x)^2} 
$$

Bring it all together (remember the LHS was $-u''$ and not $u''$) we get the discretized approximation of the poisson equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:discrete_poissoneq}
- v_{i+1} + 2v_i - v_{i-1} = 
(\Delta x)^2 f_i \quad ,
\end{equation}

for which we know;
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta x$ and $f_i$ for $\mathcal{D}(i)$,
    \item $v_i$ for $i \in \{0, n\}$.
\end{itemize}

To solve the equation we therefor need to approximate the values of $v_i \notin \{0, n\}$ via the finite difference method.
