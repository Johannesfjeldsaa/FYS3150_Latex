\begin{abstract}
    \noindent Penning traps provided technical solution on how to perform more stable measurements of charged particles, an ability that is crucial when investigating the fundamentals of particle physics. In this report we firstly derive the relations needed to numerically simulate the trap. Secondly we perform investigations of the Penning traps fundamental physics and our simultors numerical stability. Results show that a fourth order Runga-Kutta solver is able to achieve full accuracy down to five decimal points against analytical solutions when the step size is put at $h=1.5625*10^{-3}$. Further the existence of resonance behavior is investigated showing that an increase in the electric field strength reduces the Penning trap stability. Results also suggest that particle interactions via Coulomb forces also decrease the trap stability.

\section{Figures of interacting particles}

Figure \ref{fig:phase-space} and \ref{fig:two_particles_3d} are additional results used to visualize the verification of code functionality.
