\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
%
\textit{In this section we state three things in a concise manner: what we have done, what we have found, and what should or could be done in the future.}

We have investigated an implementation of the midpoint rule for numerical integration. As a first validation test we have checked that our implementation of the method reproduces the analytical result for the definite integral of $f(x) = x^3$ on $x \in [0,1]$, achieving a four-digit precision when the integration range is divided into $n=10^4$ subintervals. Furthermore, we have presented results for how the relative error of the method varies with the number of subintervals. To use these results to extract a precise estimate for the convergence rate of the method remains a topic for future work. As such, while our implementation of the midpoint rule has passed the initial validation tests, more work is needed to fully assess the validity of the implementation.
